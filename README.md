# Information 
PlaceholderAPI is a plugin for Exiled servers that lets server owners show dynamic information in things like commands, nicknames, player info, and other plugins. It uses a standard format to make it easy.

Some plugins support placeholders on their own, but others need expansions. These expansions can be downloaded directly in-game through the PAPI Expansion Cloud.

(This isn't the original project but a porting from Minecraft to SCP:SL)

## Use Expansion
Using placeholders from plugins or expansions is simple. Just place the right placeholder format (like %player_name%) in any setting that supports it. Check the plugin's manual or wiki to see where placeholders can be used.

For more details, you can always visit the [wiki](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI-SL/PlaceholderAPI/wiki)
