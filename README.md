# Information 
PlaceholderAPI is a plugin for Exiled servers that allows server owners to display information inside CommandInterpolation, Commands, Nicknames, PlayerInfo, Hints and various plugins with a uniform format. 

Support for specific plugins are provided either by the plugin itself or through expansions. The expansions may be downloaded in-game through the PAPI Expansion Cloud. 

(This isn't the original project but a porting from Minecraft to SCP:SL)

## Use Expansion
Using the placeholders of the Expansion / Plugins is a straigh forward process.  
Simply put the right placeholder format (i.e. `%player_name%`) inside whatever configuration option supports it. Please refer to any manuals or wikis a plugin may offer about what options support placeholders.

And for any more detail check out the [wiki](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI-SL/PlaceholderAPI/wiki)
